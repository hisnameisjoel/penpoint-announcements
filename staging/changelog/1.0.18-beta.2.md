# What's New in v1.0.18-beta.2

::party-popper:: **New Features**

- **Activity Tracker** -- See your daily word count, session time, writing streaks, and personal bests — all tracked locally on your device. A fun way to watch your progress build up over time.

- **Community Stats** -- Opt in to share anonymous writing stats and see live community numbers — how many authors are writing today, total words composed, and more. You can inspect exactly what gets sent, disable it any time, and request your data be deleted.

- **Manuscript Zoom** -- A Google Docs-style zoom control in the manuscript toolbar — type a custom percentage, pick a preset, or Ctrl+Scroll to adjust on the fly. Ranges from 75% to 200%, remembered between sessions.

::feather:: **Improvements**

- **Smarter Chapter Content Scanner** -- Major intelligence upgrade. Possessives and contractions are handled properly ("Lightsong's" matches "Lightsong"), multi-word names with connecting words are recognized ("God of Colors," "Tower of the Sun"), and words that consistently appear together are suggested as one name.
- **Scanner Ignore List** -- Click the eye icon to ignore any word or phrase from scanner suggestions. Ignored items are saved per book and remembered across scans.
- **Scanner Tracks Progress** -- When using "Scan Next Chapter," the scanner now tells you when every chapter has been scanned instead of looping back to the beginning.
- Standalone Flowstate page retired — it's now built directly into the Manuscript editor.
