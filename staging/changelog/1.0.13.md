# What's New in Penpoint 1.0.13

## ::party-popper:: New Features

### Profile Pictures for Items & Locations
You can now add profile pictures to your Items and Locations, just like you could with Characters! Switch to Standard or Card view and your pictures show up right in the list. Give your magical artifacts and favorite taverns the visual identity they deserve.

### App Stability & Auto-Recovery
Penpoint just got a lot harder to break. If something goes wrong on a page, you'll see a friendly recovery screen with a "Copy Error" button instead of a white screen of doom. Plus, Penpoint now has a heartbeat monitor — if the app ever stalls, it auto-refreshes to get you back to writing.

### Restart Onboarding
Want to revisit the tutorial? Head to Settings → Advanced and click "Restart Onboarding" to replay the guided tour from the beginning. Your books and data stay safe.

## ::feather:: Improvements

### Multiselect Traits
Trait dropdowns now support selecting multiple options. Your characters can be Handsome, Charming, *and* Mysterious — no more picking just one.

### Character Layout Blocks
New blocks now appear at the top of your layout instead of the bottom — no more dragging them all the way up. The block list also auto-scrolls when you drag near edges, and blocks with custom names (like "Favorite Foods") now show that name prominently.

### Duplicate Book Copies Everything
Duplicating a book now includes Arcs, Traits, Tags, and Type settings. Perfect for turning a standalone novel into a series while keeping all your world-building intact.

### Smarter Book Relocation
Moving your book storage to a new folder (like a cloud drive) is now a true move — all your data transfers completely, including profile pictures, and nothing gets left behind.

### Traits Settings Redesign
Traits now appear as compact cards in a grid instead of a tall accordion list. Click any trait to see its options and a live preview of how the dropdown looks on your character sheets.

### Profile Pictures in Lists
Character profile pictures now show up in Standard and Card view modes, making it easier to identify characters at a glance.

## ::bug:: Bug Fixes

### Item Type Icons No Longer Crash the App
Certain Item Type icons (like Glasses, Dice, or Rocket) would crash the app when viewed. Now you can use any icon without worry.

### Notes with Links Fixed
Notes containing web links would appear blank when reopened. This is fixed, and any existing affected notes will self-heal automatically.

### No More Duplicate Characters
Clicking "Add Character" could occasionally create two copies. You now always get exactly one.

### Tutorials Overhaul
Fixed tutorials pointing at wrong buttons, freezing between steps, and skipping slides on restart. A "Step X/Y" indicator now shows your progress.
