# What's New in v1.0.18-beta.1

::party-popper:: **New Features**

- **Manuscript Mode** -- The biggest feature in Penpoint's history. Write your entire manuscript inside Penpoint, right alongside your characters, locations, arcs, and worldbuilding. No more bouncing between apps.
  - A clean, distraction-free writing canvas with formatting toolbar, adjustable width, smart quotes, and em dashes
  - Scenes & Structure -- split, merge, drag-and-drop scenes and chapters to restructure your story
  - Chapter Groups -- organize chapters into parts, acts, or books with collapsible groups in the sidebar
  - Outline Sidebar -- full chapter-and-scene navigation with right-click actions
  - Flowstate for Manuscripts -- timed writing sessions built into the editor
  - Import from .docx, .epub, .md, and .txt with intelligent chapter detection
  - Export as .docx, .pdf, .rtf, or .txt at any scope (scene, chapter, or full book)
  - Manuscript Versions -- save up to 10 named snapshots and browse them in a read-only viewer
  - Scene Drafts -- try alternate directions without losing the original
  - Autosave with real-time word count
  - Full keyboard shortcut support

- **Unnumbered Chapters** -- Toggle any chapter's numbering on or off, perfect for prologues, epilogues, interludes, or title pages. Numbered chapters count up sequentially while unnumbered ones display just their title.

- **Chapter Subtitles** -- Add an optional subtitle to any chapter for taglines, epigraphs, or setting the mood. Shows up on chapter cards, detail views, and in exports.

- **Tags on Arcs** -- Tag your Story Arcs and Character Arcs with themes like "Romance," "Betrayal," or "Redemption." Tagged arcs show up in the Tags Viewer too.

::feather:: **Improvements**

- Import now accepts .txt files directly -- no more renaming to .md first
- Chapter Detail Page polish -- better spacing, subtler buttons, and long titles wrap properly
- You can now delete and recreate your main Story Arc from scratch
- Cleaner Delete Book confirmation dialog -- straightforward and clutter-free

::bug:: **Bug Fixes**

- Fixed number blocks not accepting 0 as a min/max limit, and removing a Calculate block now archives properly instead of erasing it
- Fixed arc anchor dropdowns overflowing off-screen when you have lots of plot points
- Fixed long book cover titles overflowing and having too much line spacing
- Fixed profile picture not refreshing on the character card after replacing the image
- Fixed invisible field borders on dark themes (Slate and others)
- Fixed "What's New" release notes not loading in the About page
- Fixed Startup Behavior setting showing the wrong value inside a book
- Fixed chapter reordering sometimes failing silently
- Fixed several import/export issues (multi-file re-import, folder imports, characters into existing books, empty field handling)
- Fixed Tags Viewer not scrolling with lots of tagged content
