# What's New in v1.0.17

::party-popper:: **New Features**

  - A clean, distraction-free writing canvas with formatting toolbar, adjustable width, smart quotes, and em dashes
  - Scenes & Structure — split, merge, drag-and-drop scenes and chapters to restructure your story
  - Chapter Groups — organize chapters into parts, acts, or books with collapsible groups in the sidebar
  - Outline Sidebar — full chapter-and-scene navigation with right-click actions
  - Flowstate for Manuscripts — timed writing sessions built into the editor
  - Import from .docx, .epub, .md, and .txt with intelligent chapter detection
  - Export as .docx, .pdf, .rtf, or .txt at any scope (scene, chapter, or full book)
  - Manuscript Versions — save up to 10 named snapshots and browse them in a read-only viewer
  - Scene Drafts — try alternate directions without losing the original
  - Autosave with real-time word count
  - Full keyboard shortcut support

- **Tags on Arcs** — Tag your Story Arcs and Character Arcs with themes like "Romance," "Betrayal," or "Redemption." Tagged arcs show up in the Tags Viewer too.
