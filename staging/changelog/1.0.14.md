# What's New in Penpoint 1.0.14

## ::party-popper:: New Features

### Tags in the Searchbar
Search for tags by name right from the searchbar. Tags appear as a single result showing how many things they're applied to — click to jump straight to the Tags Viewer.

### Drag & Drop Profile Pictures
Drag an image from your file browser directly onto any Character, Item, or Location profile picture while in edit mode. No file picker needed.

## ::feather:: Improvements

### Back & Forward Navigation Overhaul
Back and forward buttons now track every page you visit — including Compendium, Timeline, Notebook, and other sidebar pages. No more dead ends.

### Drag to Reorder Chapters
Drag and drop chapter cards to rearrange their order. A vertical line shows exactly where the card will land.

### Arcs in the Compendium
Story Arcs and Character Arcs now appear in the Compendium with key plot points and fortune shifts. Click any entry to jump to the Arcs page. Included in markdown exports too.

### Sort & Reorder Subtraits
Subtraits now have sort options (A-Z, Date Added, Most Used, Custom Order) and full drag-and-drop reordering. Batch-add multiple subtraits at once with the +1 button.

### Revamped Import Wizard
The Import wizard now walks you through each step with clear explanations of how templates work and what to do before picking your files.

### Smarter Character Templates
Exported templates now include instructions, show your book's actual tags and trait options, and use a cleaner layout that works great with AI tools.

### Quick Backup Access
The "Saved" indicator is now a dropdown with a "Backup Now" button and your last backup time — manual backups without leaving your page.

### Better Color Palette
12 bold, distinct colors replace the washed-out pastels. Colors stay recognizable no matter which theme you're using.

### Relationship Improvements
Add reciprocal relationships while editing, arrow direction now flows more naturally, and editing bidirectional pairs updates both sides at once.

### More Control When Duplicating Books
Characters are no longer forced when duplicating — you can exclude them just like any other data type.

### Search Title Highlighting
Search results now highlight matching text in titles as you type.

## ::bug:: Bug Fixes

### Flowstate Text Freezing
Fixed text freezing in place while your cursor kept moving, especially on smaller screens.

### Tag Merging Losing Assignments
Merging tags now preserves assignments across all entity types, not just characters.

### Crash Fixes
- Importing character templates with Tags sections no longer crashes
- Viewing items with certain icons in chapters no longer crashes
- Searching with non-English characters (ö, ä, etc.) no longer crashes

### Update "Failed" on Mac & Linux
The false "Download Failed" error after updates is gone — you'll see a friendly restart message instead.

### Text Reverting in Edit Fields
Fixed text reverting to old values when clicking away from chapter titles, descriptions, and location names.

### Dark Theme Readability
Fixed invisible dropdown text on darker themes like Slate across multiple screens.

### And More
Trait renaming updates everywhere instantly, larger fonts no longer overlap UI, modals fit smaller screens, backup intervals save correctly, and the Escape key no longer unexpectedly navigates you away.
