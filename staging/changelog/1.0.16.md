# What's New in Penpoint 1.0.16

## ::party-popper:: New Features

### Pre-Update Backups
Penpoint now automatically backs up every book in your library before installing an update. If anything ever goes wrong, you'll have a safe copy of all your work from right before it happened. You'll see a progress bar as each book is backed up, then the update installs as usual.

### Horror Template
A brand new book template built for horror fiction — complete with Creature Types, Threat Levels, Psychological Profiles, dark atmospheric location types, and 14 genre-specific tags to organize your cast across any horror sub-genre.

## ::feather:: Improvements

### Chapter Editing Redesigned
Chapter title, number, description, and type are now edited directly on the preview panel — what you see is what you get. No more bouncing between panels to tweak basic chapter info.

### Faster Performance
The character sidebar now only loads cards you can actually see, and pages load on demand instead of all at once. Big casts and book opens should feel noticeably snappier.

### View/Edit Mode Consistency
Toggling between View and Edit mode is now seamless across Chapters, Characters, Locations, and Arcs. Text no longer shifts sideways, and section spacing matches in both modes.

### Faster @Mentions
The @mention popup now feels nearly instant. After the first character, every keystroke filters locally — no more waiting for the database on each letter.

### Export Backup from Anywhere
The "Saved" dropdown now has an "Export Backup" button to save a copy of your book to any location on your computer — no need to dig through Settings.

### Character Arc Search
The character picker in the "Create Character Arc" modal is now a searchable text field. Just start typing to find who you're looking for.

### Backup Stats
The Storage & Backup settings page now shows how many backups you have, their total size, and when the last one was created.

### Short Text Blocks Expand in Edit Mode
Short text blocks now start at three lines and grow with your content instead of cutting it off.

### Location Hierarchy Drag Feedback
When dragging a location in Edit Mode, its children now visually dim so you can see where you can and can't drop.

## ::bug:: Bug Fixes

### Edits Lost When Switching to View Mode
If you typed something and immediately switched to View mode, your most recent changes could silently vanish. Data is now guaranteed to save before the switch happens.

### Large Font Size Fixes
Modals, dropdown menus, the "Show Archived" button, tag selector popup, and keyboard shortcuts popup all now scale properly with larger font sizes.

### Notebook Page Fixes
Fixed scrolling, card shifting when opening/closing notes, raw markdown in auto-generated titles, and title clearing restoring itself.

### @Mention Popup Fixes
Various fixes to the @mention dropdown for a smoother, more reliable experience.

### URL Hyperlink Popup Fixes
Create/Edit buttons are now visible, clicking the URL field no longer closes the popup, and it won't get stuck under the screen on smaller displays.

### Chapter & Scrolling Fixes
Chapter detail page scrolling works anywhere over the layout, and the Book Library page now scrolls when you have lots of books.

### Arc Fixes
Arcs page remembers which tab you were on, keyframe labels no longer hide behind neighbors, and re-clicking a selected keyframe no longer resets your selection.

### And More
Compact view spacing, reciprocal relationship toggle, block config escape key, trait overflow in edit mode, trait names in cards view, multi-select traits display, startup behavior persistence, compendium links, book library sort preference, arc keyframe crossfade, demo book item types, note color saving, note modal scrollbar, and character list click deselection — all fixed.
