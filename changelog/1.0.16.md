# What's New in Penpoint 1.0.16

## ::party-popper:: New Features

### Pre-Update Backups
Penpoint now automatically backs up every book in your library before installing an update. You'll see a progress bar as each book is backed up, then the update installs as usual. If anything ever goes wrong, you'll have a safe copy of all your work from right before it happened.

### Horror Template
A brand new book template built for horror fiction — complete with Creature Types, Threat Levels, Psychological Profiles, dark atmospheric location types, and 14 genre-specific tags to organize your cast across any horror sub-genre.

## ::feather:: Improvements

### Chapter Editing Redesigned
Chapter title, number, description, and type are now edited directly on the preview panel — what you see is what you get. No more bouncing between panels to tweak basic chapter info.

### Faster Performance
The character sidebar now only loads cards you can see, and pages load on demand instead of all at once. Big casts and book opens should feel noticeably snappier.

### View/Edit Mode Consistency
Toggling between View and Edit mode is now seamless across Chapters, Characters, Locations, and Arcs. Text no longer shifts sideways, and spacing matches in both modes.

### Faster @Mentions
The @mention popup now feels nearly instant. After the first character, every keystroke filters locally — no more waiting for the database on each letter.

### Export Backup from Anywhere
The "Saved" dropdown now has an "Export Backup" button to save a copy of your book anywhere on your computer — no need to dig through Settings.

### Other Improvements
- **Character Arc Search** — The character picker in "Create Character Arc" is now a searchable text field. Just start typing to find who you're looking for.
- **Short Text Blocks** — Short text blocks now start at three lines and grow with your content instead of cutting it off.
- **Backup Stats** — The Storage & Backup settings page now shows how many backups you have, their total size, and when the last one was created.
- **Location Hierarchy Drag Feedback** — When dragging a location in Edit Mode, its children now visually dim so you can see where you can and can't drop.
- **Selected Keyframe Clarity** — The active keyframe on arc visualizers no longer shows a clickable cursor, making it clear which one is selected.
- **Settings Rename** — "Character Setup" is now "Character Sheet Setup" to better describe what it does.

## ::bug:: Bug Fixes

### Edits Lost When Switching to View Mode
If you typed something and immediately switched to View mode, your most recent changes could silently vanish. Data is now guaranteed to save before the switch happens — no more lost keystrokes.

### Large Font Size Fixes
Modals, dropdown menus, the keyboard shortcuts popup, the Notebook "Show Archived" button, and the tag selector popup all now scale properly with larger font sizes. If you use a bigger font, things should feel a lot more polished.

### Notebook Page Fixes
Fixed scrolling with many notes, card shifting when opening/closing a note, raw markdown symbols in auto-generated titles, and note titles restoring themselves after clearing.

### Other Fixes
- **Book Library Scrolling** — If you had enough books to fill the page, you couldn't scroll to reach "Create New Book." Fixed.
- **URL Hyperlink Popup** — Create/Edit buttons are now visible, clicking the URL field no longer closes the popup, and it won't get stuck under the screen on smaller displays.
- **Trait Fixes** — Trait overflow in edit mode, outdated trait names in Cards view, and garbled multi-select traits all fixed.
- **Arc Fixes** — The Arcs page remembers which tab you were on, keyframe labels no longer hide behind neighbors, and re-clicking a selected keyframe no longer resets your selection.
- **Block Config Dropdowns** — Low contrast and cramped spacing on darker themes replaced with proper themed dropdowns.
- **Chapter Detail Scrolling** — You can now scroll with your mouse anywhere over the layout, not just the right panel.
- **Compact View Spacing** — Long character names no longer clip or leave the importance label floating awkwardly.
- **Reciprocal Relationship Toggle** — Removing a reciprocal relationship now actually removes it.
- **Startup Behavior** — "Show homepage" preference now persists between restarts.
- **Book Library Sort** — Your "Sort by" choice now sticks between sessions.
- **Note Color** — Colors set on new notes now save immediately.
- **Note Scrollbar** — The scrollbar now hugs the right edge instead of floating in the middle.
- **Character List** — Clicking the already-selected character no longer deselects them.
- **Arc Keyframe Crossfade** — Switching keyframes in view mode now smoothly crossfades.
- **Block Config Escape Key** — Pressing Escape now closes the panel.
- **Compendium Links** — Links now show the hand cursor so they look clickable.
- **@Mention Popup** — Various fixes for a smoother experience.
- **Demo Book Item Types** — Missing type labels in the Sherlock Holmes demo book now display correctly.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts Popup** — "Speedwrite" now correctly says "Flowstate."
