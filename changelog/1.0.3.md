# What's New in Penpoint 1.0.3

## üéâ New Features

### Tags Viewer Page
A brand new dedicated Tags page that lets you explore your entire book through the lens of your tags:

- **Browse All Tags** - See all your tags in one place with three sorting options: by usage count (most-used first), alphabetically, or by date created
- **Instant Tag Results** - Click any tag to instantly see every character, item, location, chapter, and note that uses that tag, all organized in expandable sections
- **Smart Filtering** - Filter results by entity type using the "Show:" buttons to quickly focus on just characters, just locations, or any combination you need
- **Content Snippets** - Each result shows a snippet of content (biography, description, or note preview) to help you understand the context at a glance
- **Quick Navigation** - Click any result to jump directly to that character, item, location, chapter, or note
- **Smooth Animations** - Collapse and expand sections with smooth animations to focus on what matters
- **State Persistence** - Your selected tag and view state persist across sessions - return to exactly where you left off
- **Browser Navigation** - Use browser back/forward buttons to navigate between different tag selections

Perfect for finding all characters with the "Antagonist" tag, all locations marked "Urban", or all chapters tagged "Climax"!

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Character selection persistence** - Fixed issue where the app wouldn't remember which character you had selected when refreshing or reopening; now properly restores your selected character just like it does for items, locations, and chapters
- **Tag deletion** - Fixed bug where attempting to delete tags would fail with an error message; tags can now be deleted successfully whether deleting one tag at a time or multiple tags in bulk
- **Tag dialog text overflow** - Fixed tag deletion and merge confirmation dialogs to properly display all text when using larger font sizes; dialog boxes now expand to fit content instead of cutting off text or buttons
- **Rich text zoom support in edit mode** - Fixed issue where zooming in and out (Ctrl+Plus/Ctrl+Minus or font size controls in Settings) would not affect text size while editing rich text fields; text now properly scales in both View and Edit modes
- **Search bar responsiveness** - Fixed search bar to shrink responsively with smaller window sizes instead of maintaining fixed width and overlapping with page titles and header elements
- **Loading screen transitions** - Fixed jarring content pop-in when refreshing or opening books; loading screen now intelligently pre-fetches page-specific data based on your last visited page

## üíÖ UI Improvements

### Tag Display Redesign
Completely refreshed tag displays across all entity types (Characters, Items, Locations, Chapters, and Notes):

- **Cleaner Look** - Tags now display with thin borders and small colored squares instead of filled backgrounds, making them easier to scan at a glance
- **Clear Labels** - In edit mode, "Selected Tags:" and "Available Tags:" labels clearly distinguish between assigned and unassigned tags
- **Usage Counts** - Available tags now show usage counts (e.g., "Dangerous 30", "London 25") to help you understand how frequently each tag is used across your book
- **Better Organization** - Sorting method selector moved to the right side for better visual separation
- **Consistent Styling** - Tags look and behave the same everywhere

### Other Improvements

- **Announcement animations** - Added smooth cascading fade-in animations to announcement overlays with clean transitions between multiple announcements
- **Tag notifications** - Tag creation and deletion notifications now appear centered at the top of the tag list for better visibility
- **Locations "Add New Location" button** - Added ghost card style "+ Add New Location" button at the bottom of the locations hierarchy list with improved creation flow
- **Number field click target** - Added underline to number input fields in edit mode to make it clearer where to click to enter values
