# What's New in Penpoint 1.0.15

## ::bug:: 1.0.15 Hotfix

### Data Stability Fix
Fixed an issue where chapter assignments (characters, locations, items) could be lost during the update process. If you updated to 1.0.14 and noticed missing assignments, restoring from your pre-update backup will recover everything.

### Arc Color Fix
Changing a character arc's color now updates the fortune curve line immediately, not just the sidebar.

## ::party-popper:: New Features

### Tags in the Searchbar
You can now search for tags by name in the searchbar. Tags appear as a single result with a count of how many things they're applied to — click one and you'll jump straight to it in the Tags Viewer.

### Drag & Drop Profile Pictures
You can now drag an image straight from your file browser onto any Character, Item, or Location profile picture while in edit mode — no file picker required.

## ::feather:: Improvements

### Drag to Reorder Chapters
You can now drag and drop chapter cards on the Chapters page to rearrange their order. A vertical line shows exactly where the card will land. No more opening each chapter individually to move it around.

### Arcs in the Compendium
Story Arcs and Character Arcs now appear in the Compendium with their key plot points and fortune shifts. Click any entry to jump to the Arcs page, and they're included in markdown exports too.

### Sort & Reorder Subtraits
Subtraits now have a sort dropdown (A-Z, Date Added, Most Used, Custom Order) and you can drag and drop them into any arrangement. Adding multiples is faster too — click +1 to add rows and save them all at once.

### Revamped Import Wizard
The Import wizard now walks you through choosing what to import, explains how templates work, and tells you exactly what to do before you pick your files.

### Smarter Character Templates
Exported character templates now include instructions at the top, show your book's actual tags and trait options, and use a cleaner layout that's easier for both you and AI tools to fill out. No more cryptic bracket syntax.

### Quick Backup Access
The "Saved" indicator in the top-right corner is now a dropdown menu with a "Backup Now" button, so you can manually backup your work anytime without leaving your current page. Also shows when your last backup was created.

### Add Reciprocal Relationships While Editing
When editing a relationship, you can now toggle on the reciprocal button to add the reverse direction without creating a new relationship. Perfect for turning one-way connections into bidirectional pairs.

### Search Title Highlighting
Search results now highlight matching text in the title as you type, so you can instantly see why each result matched your query.

### Better Color Palette
The color picker across Tags, Arcs, Books, and everywhere else now shows 12 bold, distinct colors instead of the washed-out pastels some themes were showing. Colors stay recognizable no matter which theme you're using.

### Other Improvements
- **More Control When Duplicating Books** — You can now choose to exclude characters when duplicating, just like any other data type.
- **Chapter Detail Page Scrolling** — The left side stays fixed while only the right side scrolls.
- **Escape Key No Longer Navigates Back** — Escape now just closes modals and dropdowns like you'd expect.
- **Character Arcs Select All** — View or deselect all character fortune curves with one click.
- **Settings Pages Polish** — Smooth fade transitions and a cleaner two-column layout (Book Settings and Global Settings).
- **Relationship Arrows Flipped** — Arrows now point from the character name toward the relationship type for clearer flow.
- **Item Visual Improvements** — Larger profile pictures, better card titles, and a readable grid on all screen sizes.
- **Chapter Grid on Smaller Screens** — Chapter cards now scale down gracefully instead of collapsing to one oversized column.
- **Divider Block Labels** — Simplified "Color Intensity" to just "Intensity."

## ::bug:: Bug Fixes

### Crash Fixes
- **Crash After Updating on Slower Machines** — Penpoint could crash immediately after installing an update, especially on older or slower hardware. If you were one of the unlucky ones who had to keep retrying before Penpoint would open — this one's for you.
- **Crash When Importing Character Templates** — Importing a markdown file with a Tags section could crash the app entirely. Fixed, along with several other edge cases.
- **Crash When Viewing Items in Chapters** — Certain item type icons would crash the app when viewing chapters. All item icons now display correctly.
- **Search Crash with Non-English Characters** — Searching with characters like ö, ä, or other accented letters could crash the app. Your Finnish murder mysteries are safe to search now.

### Core Fixes
- **Flowstate Text Freezing on Scroll** — Writing enough text in Flowstate could cause the visible text to freeze in place while your cursor kept moving. Fixed.
- **Back & Forward Buttons Actually Work Now** — Navigation buttons now track every page you visit, including sidebar pages like Compendium, Timeline, and Notebook.
- **Text Reverting in Edit Fields** — Fixed text reverting to old values when clicking away from chapter titles, descriptions, and location names.
- **Tag Merging Losing Assignments** — Merging tags now preserves assignments across all entity types, not just characters.
- **Relationship Block Fixes** — Fixed Save button, reciprocal pair deletion, and bidirectional editing all in one go.
- **Update "Failed" on Mac & Linux** — The false "Download Failed" error after installing updates is gone. You'll now see a friendly success message instead.
