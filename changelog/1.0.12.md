# What's New in Penpoint 1.0.12

## ::party-popper:: Arcs â€” Story Structure & Character Journeys

The biggest feature yet! The brand new **Arcs** page gives you a visual, interactive way to map out your entire narrative.

### Story Arcs
Plot your main storyline and subplots as sweeping arc curves. Add keyframes to mark major beats â€” Inciting Incident, Midpoint, Climax, and more â€” and watch your plot structure take shape. Subplots nest under your main arc and anchor to parent keyframes, so you can see exactly how your secondary storylines weave through the main plot.

### Character Arcs
Track a character's emotional fortune over time as a rising-and-falling curve. Each keyframe gets a fortune modifier (Major Rise, Minor Fall, Reset, etc.) that shapes the curve â€” you can literally see the highs and lows of your character's journey. Pick from arc templates like "Hero's Journey" or "Redemption" to get started, then overlay multiple characters to compare their emotional trajectories side by side.

### Arcs Everywhere
- **Chapters** now feature a mini arc visualizer showing which story keyframes are assigned to each chapter
- **Character Sheets** display a compact fortune curve right on the character layout
- **Search** indexes all your arcs, plot points, and keyframes so you can find them instantly

Check out the **Help Guide** for detailed walkthroughs, or run the built-in tutorial from the Help menu!

## ::feather:: Improvements

### Sherlock Demo Book Auto-Updates
When we add new features, the Sherlock Holmes demo book now automatically refreshes with new content so you can explore everything right away.

### Wider Character Sheets
Character detail panels now have more breathing room on wider screens â€” no more staring at massive empty margins.

### Character Layout Gear Icons
Gear icons on layout blocks in Settings make it easier to find and edit configurable settings for each block.

## ::bug:: Bug Fixes

### Character Name Input Fixed
The character name field no longer resets or jumps around when editing an existing character.

### Location Dropdowns Fixed
Dropdown menus for Location Type and Importance no longer show unnecessary scrollbars. "Country/Region" displays in full.

Thank you for using Penpoint! We hope Arcs helps you visualize and craft your stories like never before.
