# What's New in Penpoint 1.0.13

## ::party-popper:: New Features

### Automatic Backup System
Your work is now protected by automatic backups that run quietly in the background. Penpoint saves a backup every time you open a book, and optionally when you close it. You can also set it to save backups while you're writing (every 5-60 minutes).

Recent backups are kept by the hour, older ones by the day — so you always have the version you need without cluttering your computer. Want extra protection? Save a second copy of your backups to Dropbox, OneDrive, or any cloud folder. Configure everything in **Settings → Advanced**, and rest easy knowing your stories are safe.

### Profile Pictures for Items and Locations
Now you can add pictures to items and locations just like characters! If you switch to Standard or Card view, those pictures show up in the list too. Give your legendary sword or mysterious tavern a visual identity.

### Self-Healing Book Library
Your books are now protected against data corruption. If Penpoint's internal book list ever gets damaged or goes missing, the app automatically scans your book folders and recovers everything — names, colors, descriptions, all of it. No more lost work from unexpected crashes or file issues.

### App Stability & Auto-Recovery
If something goes wrong on a page, Penpoint now catches it before the whole app goes down. You'll see a friendly recovery screen with a "Copy Error" button to send details to support. We also log crashes and usage more accurately and make it easier to send your logs (preferably on our Discord!)

### A Proper Goodbye
When you close Penpoint, it now smoothly exits with an elegant fade to black, confirming your work is safely backed up before the curtain falls. Until next time!

### Restart Onboarding
Want to revisit the tutorial? Head to **Settings → Advanced** and click "Restart Onboarding." Your books and data stay safe — perfect for refreshing your memory or exploring features you might have missed.

## ::feather:: Improvements

### Multiselect Traits
Trait dropdowns now support selecting multiple options. Your characters can be Handsome, Charming, *and* Mysterious — no more picking just one.

### Duplicate Book Now Copies Everything
Duplicating a book now includes Arcs, Traits, Tags, and Type settings. Perfect for turning a standalone into a series while keeping all your world-building intact.

### Character Layout Blocks
New blocks appear at the top of your layout instead of the bottom — no more dragging them all the way up. The block list also auto-scrolls when you drag near the edges, and blocks with custom names (like "Favorite Foods") now show that name prominently so you can tell them apart at a glance.

### Smarter Book Relocation
Moving your book storage to a new folder (like a cloud drive) is now a true move — all your data transfers completely, including profile pictures, and nothing gets left behind.

### Traits Settings Redesign
Traits now appear as compact cards in a grid instead of a tall accordion list. Click any trait to see its options and a live preview of how the dropdown will look on your character sheets.

### Profile Pictures in Lists
Character profile pictures now show up in Standard and Card view modes, making it easier to identify characters at a glance.

## ::bug:: Bug Fixes

### Critical Fixes
- **Item Type Icons Crash** - Certain Item Type icons (like Glasses, Dice, or Rocket) would crash the app. Now you can use the sunglasses icon in peace.
- **Notes with Links** - Notes containing web links would appear blank when reopened. Existing affected notes will self-heal automatically.
- **Duplicate Characters on Creation** - Clicking "Add Character" could occasionally create two copies. You now always get exactly one.
- **Character Layout Preview Crash** - Toggling View/Edit mode in Character Layout settings no longer crashes.

### Other Fixes
- Profile images survive book moves - moving your book to a new folder no longer breaks profile image links
- Flowstate content properly clears when switching books
- Tutorials completely overhauled - fixed wrong buttons, freezing, skipping slides; added "Step X/Y" progress indicator
- Arcs page sidebar alignment, color picker positioning, and tutorial transitions all improved
- First location creation no longer mispositions the input field
- Delete item modal properly closes after deletion
- Onboarding book creation now saves correctly
- macOS app icon fixed for newer Macs running Sequoia
- Cards view remembers your selected data block
- Fast typing in Type names no longer loses changes
- Navigation sidebar scales properly on smaller screens
