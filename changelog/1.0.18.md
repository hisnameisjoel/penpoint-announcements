# What's New in Penpoint 1.0.18

## ::star:: Introducing Manuscript Mode

The biggest feature in Penpoint's history. You can now **write your entire manuscript inside Penpoint** — right alongside your characters, locations, arcs, and worldbuilding. No more bouncing between apps. One place for your story, start to finish.

**The Writing Experience** — A clean, distraction-free canvas with a fixed toolbar for formatting. Canvas width is adjustable — Narrow, Standard, or Wide. Smart quotes and em dashes convert automatically as you type.

**Scenes & Structure** — Your chapters are made up of scenes. Split any scene in two with Ctrl+Shift+Enter, or start a new chapter with Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Enter. Delete a divider to merge scenes back together. Drag and drop scenes and chapters to restructure your story. Choose from six scene divider styles.

**Chapter Groups** — Organize chapters into groups like "Part I," "Book Two," or "Act Three." Groups are collapsible, renamable, and show up in the outline sidebar.

**Outline Sidebar** — A full chapter-and-scene navigation panel. Click a chapter to read the whole thing, a scene to focus on just that piece, or "Full Book" to see your entire manuscript. Right-click for quick actions.

**Flowstate for Manuscripts** — Flowstate is now built directly into the editor. Start a timed writing session (Ctrl+Shift+F), and your existing text locks behind you — you can only write forward.

**Import & Export** — Bring existing work in from .docx, .epub, .md, and .txt files with automatic chapter detection. Export as .docx, .pdf, .rtf, or .txt — a single scene, a chapter, or the full book.

**Manuscript Versions** — Save named snapshots of your entire manuscript at any point. Browse old versions in a read-only viewer. Up to 10 per book.

**Scene Drafts** — Try a different direction for a scene without losing the original. Create multiple drafts, give each a description, and restore any draft when you're ready.

**Autosave & Keyboard Support** — Every change saves automatically. Scene breaks, chapter breaks, Flowstate toggle, all formatting — everything has a keyboard shortcut.

## ::party-popper:: New Features

### Unnumbered Chapters
Toggle any chapter's numbering on or off — perfect for prologues, epilogues, interludes, or title pages. Numbered chapters still count up sequentially while unnumbered ones display just their title.

### Chapter Subtitles
An optional subtitle field for taglines, epigraphs, or setting the mood. Shows up on chapter cards, the detail view, and in exports.

### Manuscript Zoom
A Google Docs-style zoom control — type a custom percentage, pick a preset, or Ctrl+Scroll to adjust on the fly. 75% to 200%, remembered between sessions.

### Tags on Arcs
Tag your Story Arcs and Character Arcs just like everything else. Add "Romance," "Betrayal," or "Redemption" to track thematic threads. Tagged arcs show up in the Tags Viewer too.

### Activity Tracker
See your daily word count, session time, writing streaks, and personal bests — all tracked locally on your device.

### Community Stats
Opt in to share anonymous writing stats and see live community numbers — how many authors are writing today, total words composed, and more. Fully transparent and easy to disable.

## ::feather:: Improvements

### Smarter Chapter Content Scanner
Possessives and contractions are handled properly — "Lightsong's" matches "Lightsong" instead of creating gibberish. Multi-word names are recognized, and words that consistently appear together are suggested as one name.

### Scanner Ignore List
Click the eye icon to ignore any word or phrase. Ignored items are saved per book and remembered across scans.

### Other Improvements
- **Scanner Knows When You're Done** — Tells you when every chapter has been scanned instead of looping back to the beginning.
- **Import Now Accepts .txt Files** — No more renaming before importing.
- **Chapter Detail Page Polish** — Better spacing, subtler buttons, and long titles wrap properly.
- **Delete Your Main Story Arc** — Start fresh with a clear confirmation dialog.
- **Cleaner Delete Book Dialog** — Streamlined: delete, type name, confirm. Done.
- **Standalone Flowstate Retired** — Flowstate has graduated into Manuscript Mode.

## ::bug:: Bug Fixes

### Chapter Reordering Could Fail
Moving or deleting chapters would sometimes silently fail if chapters were internally out of order. Now it works every time.

### Import & Export Fixes
Multi-file exports can now be re-imported, folder imports no longer choke on the summary file, importing characters with existing chapters works, and empty fields no longer export as "(empty)".

### Manuscript Editor Fixes
- Tab and Shift+Tab stay inside the editor instead of wandering into the toolbar
- Turning off chapter numbers hides the heading above your title too
- Blank lines in notes and rich text fields stay the size you intended
- @mention trailing space, cursor jumping after em dash, and scene divider flashing — all fixed
- Escape closes just the @mention popup, not the note behind it

### Other Fixes
- Context menu contrast on Slate theme and invisible field borders on dark themes
- "What's New" release notes now load properly
- Startup setting displays your actual choice everywhere
- Profile pictures refresh immediately when replaced
- Notebook back/forward no longer swaps notes silently
- Book cover titles scale properly for long names
- Tags Viewer and manuscript outline now scroll correctly
- Character list scrolling is smooth regardless of profile pictures
- Item importance dropdown, symbol picker overflow, and chapter title duplication — all fixed
- Location default icon restored to the picker, and chosen icons show up in all dropdowns
