# What's New in Penpoint 1.0.10

## 🎉 New Features

### Flowstate Writing Mode
Ever find yourself stuck in an endless loop of editing instead of writing? Flowstate is your escape. It's a distraction-free writing space with a twist: once you finish a sentence, it locks behind you. No going back, no second-guessing — just forward momentum.

A built-in timer alternates between focused writing sprints and editing breaks, so you get the best of both worlds. When the timer runs, your words lock in; when it pauses, you're free to polish. Check out the Help Guide for the full rundown on how to use Flowstate.

### More Export Formats
The Export Wizard now supports way more than just markdown! Export your book data to:
- Word documents (.docx)
- PDFs
- Rich Text (.rtf)
- Plain text (.txt)

Perfect for sharing with editors, printing, or importing into your favorite word processor. All formats work with both single-file and multi-file export modes.

### Quick Page Navigation
Jump to any page instantly with Ctrl+1 through Ctrl+9 (Cmd on Mac):
- Characters is 1
- Items is 2
- All the way to Compendium at 9

No more clicking through the sidebar when you're in the zone — just hit a number and you're there.

### Reset Demo Book
Made a mess of the Sherlock Holmes demo while exploring? You can now reset it to its original state from the book selector's options menu (the three dots). Your renamed or duplicated copies of the demo stay safe.

### Keyboard Shortcuts Reference
Ever wonder what Ctrl+E does? Now you can find out! Click the Help icon (?) in the top-right corner and select "Keyboard Shortcuts" to see every shortcut in Penpoint, organized by category.

## 💅 Improvements

### @Mentions in Exports
When you export your book to markdown, @mentions are now converted to readable names instead of cryptic links.

### Glorious Searchbar Fixes
Implemented a smarter search algorithm that can handle most English morphological variations (plurals, verb tenses, -ing/-ed/-tion suffixes).

### Better Color Palette
Fixed many of the color themes to have more aesthetically pleasing colors that better fit the theme.

### Notebook Card Font Sizes
Individual notes in their small 'card' format now use smaller, more preview-like fonts that play nice with each other.

### Book Names Now Expanded
You can now put symbols like " - : ; and more into your book names.

### Note Title Length Limits
Note titles now have a 50 character limit to match other entity names, preventing export issues.
