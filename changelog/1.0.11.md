# What's New in Penpoint 1.0.11

## ::party-popper:: New Features

### Character Profile Pictures
Give your characters a face! Add profile pictures from the Character page in edit mode — just click the portrait frame to upload an image, then crop it to perfection. In view mode, click the picture to see a beautiful full-size lightbox. When you export, you can choose to include profile pictures alongside your character data.

### New User Onboarding & Tutorials
The New User experience is now complete with fancy starting animations and a proper flow. All major pages in the app now have complete tutorials to help guide you through the features and functions of the app. Perfect for getting started with Penpoint or discovering features you might have missed!

### Item Chapter Assignments
Items now show which chapters they appear in. You can also assign items to chapters directly from the Item page — no need to navigate to each chapter individually. This makes it much easier to track when and where your key items appear in your story.

### Clickable Tags
Tags are now clickable! When viewing any character, item, location, chapter, or note card, click on a tag to jump straight to the Tags page with that tag already selected. It's a faster way to find everything connected by a common theme — perfect for when you're thinking "show me everyone tagged 'villain'" without having to navigate and search manually.

### Window Memory
Penpoint now remembers exactly where you left it. Resize the window, move it to your second monitor, maximize it — next time you open the app, it'll be right where you want it. First-time users get a nicely sized window that adapts to their screen instead of a one-size-fits-all default.

### Smarter Item Filters
Filter dropdowns on the Items page now grey out options that wouldn't return any results based on your other active filters. No more clicking through empty combinations to find what you're looking for.

### Prettier Search Dropdowns
Those autocomplete dropdowns when assigning items, characters, locations, and chapters now look a whole lot nicer. Each result shows an icon matching its type (characters get a little person, items show their archetype icon, etc.), plus a clear label underneath so you always know what you're picking. Search text gets highlighted as you type, matching the style of @mentions. No more squinting at a wall of plain text wondering "is this a sword or a character named Sword?"

### Browse Before You Search
When adding locations, items, chapters, or relationships to a character, the dropdown now shows your entire list sorted alphabetically — no typing required. Forgot the exact name of that tavern? Just scroll through and find it. Once you start typing, the list smartly narrows down to the top matches. It's the best of both worlds: browse when you're unsure, search when you know what you want.

### Sticky Detail Panels
The detail panel now stays put when scrolling through items or locations, so you can always see what you're looking at.

### Smart Dashes
Type `--` for an en dash (–) or `---` for an em dash (—) in Flowstate and all rich text fields. No more hunting for special characters.

### Consolidated Types Settings
Item Types and Location Types are now on the same settings page, side by side. Less clicking around, easier to manage both at once.

### Clickable Chapter Assignments
Items and Locations listed on a chapter's detail page are now clickable links, just like Characters and POV. Click any assigned element to jump straight to its detail page.

### Faster Adding
Adding owners to items, and adding characters/locations/items to chapters now takes fewer clicks. The dropdown opens immediately and your selection is applied instantly — no extra confirmation button needed.

### Trait Settings Shortcut
Trait dropdowns in the Character Page now include a "Configure Traits" link at the bottom for quick access to customizing your trait options.

### Richer Tags Cards
The Tags Viewer now has much better card displays! More information, visual formatting like Notes, and the @mention links are now preserved.

## ::bug:: Bug Fixes

### Relationship Map Improvements
Fixed overlapping cards in grouped layout — character cards no longer pile on top of each other when communities were placed close together. Now there's proper breathing room between everyone. Also fixed community bubbles using too-similar colors (three shades of brown in a row, really?). Now adjacent communities get visually distinct colors.

### Flowstate Fixes
Fixed several Flowstate issues: quote marks now face the correct direction when starting dialogue, the editor automatically scrolls as you type to keep your cursor visible, and the cursor no longer drifts below the text it's supposed to be next to.

### New Items Open in Edit Mode
When you create a new Item, it now opens straight into Edit mode so you can start filling in details immediately. No more extra click to switch from View to Edit. Characters already did this — now Items do too.

### Cramped Dropdown Menus in Edit Mode
When assigning relationships, items, locations, or chapters to a character, the search dropdown was squished to fit the tiny input box. "Captain William Dangerfield the Third" doesn't like being truncated. The dropdown now has room to breathe, showing full names without cutting them off mid-syllable.

### Item Links from Characters
Clicking an item on a character's page would take you to the Items tab but show the wrong item — whatever you had open last time. Now it correctly opens the item you actually clicked.

### Locations Add Button Layout Shift
The "Add New Location" button no longer vanishes when you're creating a location. It now fades to half opacity while the entry form is visible, keeping everything in place.
