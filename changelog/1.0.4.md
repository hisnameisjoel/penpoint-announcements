# What's New in Penpoint 1.0.4

## üéâ New Features

### Smart Quotes (Curly Quotes)
Penpoint now automatically converts straight quotes to proper typographic quotes as you type, giving your writing a professional, published look:
- Straight double quotes (") become opening (") or closing (") curly quotes based on context
- Straight apostrophes (') become opening (') or closing (') curly quotes
- Apostrophes in contractions (like "don't" or "it's") automatically use the correct closing quote
- Works everywhere: character names, location names, item names, chapter titles, text fields, notes, and all rich text areas
- Smart enough to know when to use opening vs. closing quotes based on what comes before (after spaces, punctuation, or at the start of text)
- Cross-platform support: works identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Example: typing `"Sherlock's room"` automatically becomes `"Sherlock's room"`

### Insert New Chapter
You can now insert chapters anywhere in your story! When viewing a chapter, click the "Insert New Chapter" button to choose whether to insert before or after the current chapter. All subsequent chapters automatically renumber themselves to make room for the new chapter.

## üíÖ Improvements

### New Export & Import Wizard
A brand new page in settings/import & export will walk you through exporting all your Penpoint book data to markdown format and back again. Perfect for processing with LLM tools or for exporting to a word processor!

### Template Generation Wizard
The "Generate Templates" button in Import/Export now opens a step-by-step wizard similar to the Export feature, letting you choose exactly which template types you want (Characters, Locations, Items, Notes, or Chapters) instead of always generating all five. Templates are saved as individual markdown files in a templates/ folder for easier organization and use with AI tools.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Settings Navigation Toggle
Fixed issue where clicking the Settings button while already in a settings subcategory (like Traits Manager or Character Layout) wouldn't take you back to the settings home page. Now clicking Settings again properly returns you to the settings overview where you can choose a different category.

### Glorious Searchbar Modal (Ctrl+K)
Fixed critical bug where the fullscreen search modal wouldn't respond to typing or clicking on results. Modal search now works identically to the inline navbar search, with full keyboard navigation support (arrow keys, Enter to select) and proper result expansion to fill available vertical space. Modal mode now shows up to 100 results (up from 50) to take advantage of the larger display area.

### Chapter Navigation Animations
Fixed jarring chapter transition animations where content would update too early. When navigating between chapters using arrow keys or clicking next/previous, the current chapter now smoothly slides out completely before the new chapter slides in, preventing the disorienting flash where new content appeared mid-animation. This applies to chapter titles, descriptions, chapter details, author notes, and all assignments (characters, locations, items).
