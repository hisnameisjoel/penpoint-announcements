# What's New in Penpoint 1.0.8

## 🎉 New Features

### Help & User Guide System
Penpoint now includes a comprehensive Help menu in the top-right corner! Access 25+ tutorial articles covering every feature in the app:
- **Visual demos** showing features in action
- **Hierarchical navigation** to browse by topic
- **Full-text search** to find exactly what you need
- **Clickable links** that take you directly to relevant pages and settings

Whether you're a new user learning the basics or an experienced writer discovering advanced features, the Help system is your complete guide to mastering Penpoint.

### Sticky Rich Text Toolbars
The rich text formatting toolbar now stays visible while scrolling through long character bios, location descriptions, and other text fields in edit mode. No more scrolling back to the top to apply formatting—your text styling options are always accessible exactly where you need them.

## 💅 Improvements

### Smoother Navigation Sidebar
The navigation sidebar now features smooth expand/collapse animations, making the app feel more polished and responsive:
- Content area gracefully shifts to make room when pinning or unpinning the sidebar
- Faster, more responsive collapse timing when your mouse leaves the sidebar
- Natural transitions that enhance the overall user experience

### Intuitive Chapter Reorder Controls
Chapter number controls have been redesigned with left/right arrows (← →) that match the Previous/Next chapter navigation pattern:
- **Left arrow** moves chapter earlier in your story
- **Right arrow** moves chapter later in your story
- More intuitive visual language that makes reordering feel natural

### Enhanced Timeline Animations
Timeline zooming is now silky smooth with bell-curve easing:
- Eliminated stuttering and background element lag when zooming in/out
- Fluid, professional-quality zoom transitions
- Character names now use consistent colors matching dropdown menus for better visual harmony

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Windows Installer Persistence (Critical Fix)
Fixed a critical issue where Penpoint would disappear from the Windows Start Menu and "Apps & Features" after restarting your computer. The app now properly persists across reboots, ensuring you can always find and launch Penpoint when you need it.

### Chapter Reordering Updates
Fixed chapter numbers not updating in real-time when using the reorder buttons. Chapter positions now update immediately in the UI without requiring a page refresh.

### Rich Text Improvements
- Fixed keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+0/1/2/3) for heading styles now preserve highlighted text instead of deleting it
- Fixed Ctrl+V paste creating hyperlinks instead of pasting plain text when text is selected
- Fixed formatting issues that could sometimes appear in rich text boxes
- Hyperlinks now always show underlines for better visibility in both view and edit modes

### Better Page Transitions
- Removed brief flash of "Loading chapter..." and "Chapter not found" messages when opening chapters from the grid
- Optimized layouts between view and edit mode for smoother transitions
- Fixed page scrolling back to top when creating new items in character sheets—you now stay at the Items section after adding an item
