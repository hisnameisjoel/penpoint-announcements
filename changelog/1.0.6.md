# What's New in Penpoint 1.0.6

## üéâ New Features

### Interactive Relationship Map

Explore your character relationships in a stunning new visual format! Access the Relationship Map from the navigation sidebar to see all your character connections come to life:

- **Smart Positioning**: Characters appear as interactive cards positioned by importance. Highly connected characters cluster near the center, while isolated characters appear at the edges
- **Smooth Animated Entrance**: Character cards emerge from the center and float to their positions with elegant staggered timing on first load
- **Click to Focus**: Click any character to smoothly zoom and pan to center their relationship network, fading out unrelated characters for clarity
- **Relationship Detail Panel**: Slides in from the right, showing all of the selected character's connections with directional arrows (outgoing ‚Üí, incoming ‚Üê, or bidirectional ‚Üî)
- **Navigate Between Characters**: Click names in the detail panel to smoothly transition between each character's network
- **Hover Highlights**: Hover over any character or relationship line to highlight it with smooth color transitions
- **Bidirectional Relationships**: Display as two gracefully curved arrows, each with its own relationship label
- **Color Gradients**: Relationship lines use color gradients that blend between the connected characters' theme colors
- **Powerful Filtering**: Filter your view by relationship direction (outgoing, incoming, reciprocal), specific character, or character importance level
- **Pan and Zoom**: Freely explore your entire relationship web, or click the background to deselect and return to the full view

Perfect for writers managing complex character dynamics across large casts or series with interconnected storylines!

### Page Transitions

Navigation between pages now features smooth crossfade transitions for a more polished, app-like feel:

- When switching between pages, the current page fades out while the new page fades in simultaneously
- Pages wait until fully loaded before transitioning, so you never see half-rendered content or loading spinners
- Data cascade animations (like character lists fading in row-by-row) only play once per page load, preventing jarring re-animations during navigation
- Transitions are fast (400ms) and subtle, prioritizing usability over flashiness
- Works seamlessly with browser back/forward buttons and all navigation methods
- The old page stays static during the transition to prevent distracting refreshes or content shifts

### Global Settings from Book Selector

Settings are now accessible from the book selection screen via a gear icon in the top-right corner. You can access Interface, Announcements, Advanced, and About settings without opening a book!

### Restore Backup from Book Selector

Restore .penpoint backup files directly from the book selection screen without creating a placeholder book first. Restored books are automatically named with "(Recovered)" suffix to avoid conflicts.

### Customizable Text Line Height

New setting in Settings ‚Üí Interface to adjust line spacing from Single (1.0) to Double (2.0). Applies globally to all text including rich text fields and block list items (relationships, items, locations, chapters). Defaults to Normal (1.15) for comfortable reading.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Nested Bullet Point Duplication

Fixed bug where nested bullet points in rich text fields (like character skills or traits) would duplicate in view mode, showing child items multiple times under parent entries. Nested lists now render correctly with each item appearing only once.

### Tag Color Updates

Fixed issue where changing tag colors after creation would fail silently with "Failed to update tag" error. Tags can now be successfully updated with new colors and names.

### Glorious Searchbar Modal Height

Fixed modal search (Ctrl+K) expanding to fill the screen when displaying results. Modal now maintains a fixed height and uses scrolling for overflow results.

### Glorious Searchbar Fullscreen Transition

Fixed visual overlap when clicking the fullscreen button in the navbar search. Inline dropdown now closes smoothly before the modal opens, and your search text carries over automatically.

## üíÖ Improvements

### Faster Update Rollouts

Penpoint now checks for updates on every app launch (instead of once per day) and continues checking every 12 hours while running. Added "Automatic Update Checking" toggle in Settings ‚Üí About for users who prefer to stay offline.

### Reduced Log File Size

Significantly reduced logging verbosity by removing repetitive autosave success logs and consolidating navigation logs. Log files are now ~85-90% smaller while retaining all important error and diagnostic information.
