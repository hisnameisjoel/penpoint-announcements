# What's New in Penpoint 1.0.5

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Critical Database Migration Fix

We've fixed a critical issue that prevented some users from opening their books after upgrading from v1.0.3 to v1.0.4. **The good news**: Your data was never lost, it was just inaccessible due to a database migration checksum mismatch.

**What happened?** When you upgraded from v1.0.3 to v1.0.4, your database stored a checksum of the migration files. Unfortunately, there was a mismatch in one of those files between what you installed and what was in the official release, causing Penpoint to refuse to open your books with an error message.

**The fix:** v1.0.5 now automatically detects and repairs affected databases when you open a book. The repair happens instantly and silently in the background - you won't even notice it. All your data remains intact and accessible.

If you were unable to open your books after the v1.0.4 update, this release will fix that immediately. Simply update to v1.0.5 and open your book normally.

### Chapter Grid Layout Fix

Fixed a visual bug where chapter cards in the grid view had inconsistent heights - some rows appeared smaller than others, creating an uneven appearance. All chapter cards now maintain uniform size across all rows for a cleaner, more polished look.

## üíÖ Improvements

### Dynamic @ Mention Links

**This is a game-changer for organizing your writing!** @ mentions are now truly dynamic, meaning they automatically update when you rename characters, locations, items, or chapters.

**How it works:**
- When you @ mention a character (like `@Sherlock Holmes`) in your notes, character bios, location descriptions, or anywhere else, Penpoint creates a link to that character
- Previously, if you renamed "Sherlock Holmes" to "Enola Holmes", all your existing @ mentions would still show the old name
- **Now**, when you rename an entity, all @ mention links throughout your entire book automatically update to show the new name!

**Where it works:**
- Character biographies and notes
- Location descriptions and details
- Item notes and descriptions
- Chapter details and author notes
- All rich text fields everywhere in Penpoint

**Backward compatible:** Your existing @ mentions continue to work exactly as before. This enhancement is fully automatic and requires no action on your part.

**Perfect for writers who:**
- Evolve character names as their story develops
- Rename locations to better fit the narrative
- Want to keep their notes synchronized without manual find-and-replace

### Interface Settings Redesign

We've simplified the Settings ‚Üí Interface page for a cleaner, more focused experience:

**What changed:**
- Removed the busy "Live Preview" section that took up too much vertical space
- Reorganized all settings into a clean two-column layout
- **Left column** groups appearance settings: Color Theme, Typography, and Font Size
- **Right column** groups behavior settings: Animation Style and Startup Behavior
- Settings are now easier to find and less overwhelming to navigate

### Settings Navigation Improvements

We've increased the width of the settings category list by 35% to reduce text wrapping and improve readability. Longer category names like "Import & Export" and "Character Layout" now fit comfortably on one line.
